- **Smooth scrolling optimizations**
- **Hardware acceleration** with transform: translateZ(0)

### Animation Controls
- **CSS variables** for consistent timing
- **Media queries** for motion preferences
- **Hardware acceleration** for transform animations
- **Optimized keyframes** for 60fps performance

### Performance Classes Added
```css
.gpu-accelerated
.smooth-animation
.fast-animation
.will-change-transform
.will-change-opacity
.optimized-hover
```
